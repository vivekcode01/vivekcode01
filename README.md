Hi, I’m Vivek. I’m in my final year of BTech in Information Technology and I like to think of myself as a tech nomad — always curious, always exploring.

I’m passionate about full-stack development and fascinated by how AI can be blended into real-world projects. What excites me most is solving problems and creating systems that feel seamless and natural, the kind you don’t notice because they just work.

Right now, I’m focused on learning, building, and collaborating — always looking for opportunities to grow and contribute.
